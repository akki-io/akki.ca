            I am a Laravel Developer who specializes in Backend Service
            Development and API development. I design and develop websites and
            modern backend applications. I have a passion for web standards and
            solving interesting problems.

            I am a big fan of Shred Life. Although I cannot cook I can blend a
            mean protein shake. I love spending the weekend outside exploring
            the area, playing sports, and harassing my dog. (He secretly loves
            it, of course.). I enjoy working on JavaScript applications, car
            MODs, and drinking beer.

            I am also into ink. Got the right sleeve done, left half sleeve and
            multiple big ones on my back, sides, and calves which include
            Polynesian, Japanese, Tribal, some Blackwork, Aztez, Sanskrit
            Script.

            Motivating people to be the best versions of themselves is what I
            love waking up to do everyday.
